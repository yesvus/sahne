# Agent instructions — Sahne

## Mission
Produce deterministic motion graphics and informative animations **from code**. Do not introduce diffusion-based video generation, prompt-to-video model APIs, a custom timeline editor, or cloud infrastructure without an explicit product decision.

## Stack
Node.js 22+, pnpm 10+, TypeScript/React, Remotion 4 (pin `remotion` and all `@remotion/*` packages to exactly the same version), Zod.

## Rules
1. Keep scene **content** in JSON/typed data and visuals in React components.
2. Animations MUST depend on `useCurrentFrame()` (and `useVideoConfig()` where needed). No `setTimeout`, CSS keyframe animation, arbitrary nondeterministic `Math.random()` or stateful playback-dependent movement.
3. Validate untrusted scene data. Make metrics/claims in example animations explicitly illustrative unless sourced.
4. Treat 1920×1080 at 30 fps as the default output; other formats need explicit options.
5. Keep MVP local-first and make additions testable. Avoid new dependencies unless there is a concrete need.
6. Run `pnpm typecheck` and `pnpm test` before PRs; render a sample MP4 for visual changes when a supported browser is available.
7. When editing visual components, use Remotion Studio and inspect beginning, middle, and final frames; no clipped text, unreadable fonts, or off-canvas items.
8. Track work in scoped GitHub issues with acceptance criteria. Use feature branches and PRs for substantial changes.

## Multi-scene manifests

Prefer a versioned JSON manifest over hand-coded one-off sequences. V1 supports ordered `metrics` scenes with explicit integer `durationInFrames` and typed scene `props`. Validate with `manifestSchema`, keep IDs unique, and use `getSceneWindows()` for half-open boundaries. See `docs/scene-manifest.md`.

Do not bake scene durations into global time calculations or use wall-clock time. New scene types must be introduced through a schema variant and renderer dispatch with tests.

## Visual primitives

Use `src/design/tokens.ts` for typography, colors and 16:9 safe-area defaults; use pure functions in `src/design/motion.ts` for timing and easing. Assemble templates from `SceneCanvas`, `SceneHeader`, and `MetricBar` rather than duplicating CSS or interpolation logic. The duration passed to a scene within a `Series.Sequence` must be the **local** duration, not the total video duration. Inspect contrast and clipping at 1080p. See `docs/style-guide.md`.

## Scene templates

The v1 manifest schema also accepts `title`, `stat`, and `comparison` variants in addition to `metrics`. Keep every variant's props strictly validated, always pass local sequence duration, and use frame-based motion. Consult `docs/templates.md` and `examples/templates.json`. Render `pnpm render:templates:smoke` for a cross-template smoke check and inspect clips visually.
